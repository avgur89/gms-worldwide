                p.solution__desc The A2P SMS market is booming and is estimated to be worth around USD 70.32 Billion by 2020. And yet, many operators are still losing huge profits to grey routes, and fraudulent messaging which have recently risen by 27.2% in P2P and 40.9% in A2P. This rise comes with many challenges for the MNOs: spam, spoofing, malware distribution, flooding, faking and others.
                h4.solution__subtitle Lacking control over their messaging volumes, mobile operators lose revenue and remain vulnerable:
                img.solution__img(src="static/img/weak_spots.png" alt="")
                p.solution__desc As evident from the graph, unauthorized traffic inflates the messaging volumes and overloads the network. In fact, this grey routes traffic brings no additional value, while increasing capital and operational expenditures, literally causing the operators to lose revenue. Because of how intertwined the schemes of revenue denial in P2P and A2P are, it takes a deep understanding of the messaging industry and experience with both A2P and P2P to fix the problem effectively and in its entirety.

                            p.stages__stage-desc GMS Firewall is a powerful, rules-based system which is highly configurable and can target specific message types to remove known threats. It also uses intelligent algorithms to classify messages as spam based on unusual patterns of submission or content. Having this tool gives the MNO an opportunity to categorize its international A2P traffic and see who the TOP traffic sender is, trends, stats and more.
                            p.stages__stage-desc The functionality provided by the Firewall has accumulated experience in dealing with real fraudulent behaviors in the region.
                            p.stages__stage-desc Firewall can also underpin revenue assurance initiatives to block grey routes and to maximize messaging revenues. The platform stops fraudulent messages that are impossible to bill, ensuring that network bandwidth is enough for revenue generating traffic coming via authorized routes.
                            p.stages__stage-desc Firewall also ensures that local content providers cannot bypass international A2P traffic (domestic routes are often used for cheaper traffic termination).
                            p.stages__stage-desc Firewall solution is deployed on Linux based platforms. The solution is fully scalable and could be placed on classic turnkey hardware & software package, as well as deployed into a Virtual Environment.

                p.stages__desc At GMS, our goal is to bring progress to our partners, and monetization is one way of effectively assuring prosperity and continued growth of the operators. With monetization deployed, you find order where chaos used to be, and the traffic which used to cost you turned into a source of revenue. With unauthorized traffic denied access, part of that volume will go through legitimate operator-approved channels increasing profits, and the rest, including fraudulent messaging, will no longer put pressure on the network and affect subscriber loyalty. We strive to achieve this result: from successfully deploying the solution itself to providing training for your staff.

                                h5 Solution:
                                p Firewall was deployed, managed, and regularly updated, allowing to identify and block the illegitimate traffic algorithms. Remote management of international SMS business was established. Smart pricing policy grounded in market trends was implemented.
                                h5 Impact:
                                p Restricting spam and illegitimate traffic provided full visibility of the messaging volumes. Capital and operational costs reduction, combined with maximized A2P and P2P traffic monetization allowed the profits from messaging to increase by up to 2400% of incremental revenue growth.

                                h5 Solution:
                                p Network testing and monitoring combined with a flexible Firewall solution allowed to detect and block of grey routes.

                                h5 Impact:
                                p Operational costs were reduced.  International P2P traffic became fully secured and transparent. Local A2P links were taken under control to enable maximum monetization of international A2P SMS traffic. Subscribers' security was improved by restricting international traffic termination exclusively through monetized channels with original Sender IDs and content. Monetization of international A2P SMS allowed for incremental revenue growth of 946%.

                                h5 Solution:
                                p Proactive network monitoring and tests enabled the operator to detect and block grey route traffic. International P2P traffic was migrated to GMS HUB which allowed to keep the network secure at all times, and new types of traffic were attracted after negotiations with the international market. Contracts with local A2P aggregators were revised.
                                h5 Impact:
                                p International A2P and P2P traffic became protected and fully monetized. SMS business grew due to new types of traffic attracted to the now secured network. Reduction of operational costs and transparency of international P2P traffic exchange, combined with a 100% A2P traffic monetization allowed incremental revenue to grow by more than 700%.
